# Time-and-Weather
### A time and weather app using JavaScript and OpenWeatherMap API.<br><br>
You can chooose between darkmode and lightmode by pressing the Sun/Moon button. <br><br>
You can enter the city name and press enter to get the weather data of the city at the current time.<br><br>
The weather data is fetched from **OpenWeatherMap** and **Countryflag.io**'s APIs which shows the <kbd>City name</kbd>,<kbd>Country name</kbd>, <kbd>Country flag</kbd>, <kbd>Weather condition</kbd> , <kbd>Temperature</kbd>, and <kbd>Wind speed</kbd> at the current time. <br><br>

You can see the the analog clock as well as the digital one accurate to the second. The second, minute and hour hands are animated using CSS animations. 
The date is also shown alongside the time. <br><br>

#### The demo is live at  *https://therealrajan.github.io/Time-and-Weather/* <br><br>
### APIs used
 > **[OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)** for weather data
 > <br> **[FlagsAPI](https://www.flagsapi.com)** for flag images.

Any suggestions to improve the app are always welcome. <br><br>
